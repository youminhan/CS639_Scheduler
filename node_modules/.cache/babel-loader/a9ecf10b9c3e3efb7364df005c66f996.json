Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software.\",\n    keywords: [\"computer\", \"science\", \"programming\", \"java\"],\n    name: \"Programming 3\",\n    number: \"COMP SCI 400\",\n    requisites: [[\"glv\"]],\n    sections: {\n      LEC_001: {\n        instructor: \"Gary Dahl\",\n        location: \"AB20 Weeks Hall for Geological Sciences\",\n        subsections: {},\n        time: {\n          thursday: \"2:30pm - 3:45pm\",\n          tuesday: \"2:30pm - 3:45pm\"\n        }\n      },\n      LEC_002: {\n        instructor: \"Gary Dahl\",\n        location: \"132 Noland Hall\",\n        subsections: {},\n        time: {\n          thursday: \"1:00pm - 2:15pm\",\n          tuesday: \"1:00pm - 2:15pm\"\n        }\n      },\n      LEC_003: {\n        instructor: \"Mouna Ayari Ben Hadj Kacem\",\n        location: \"AB20 Weeks Hall for Geological Sciences\",\n        subsections: {},\n        time: {\n          friday: \"11:00am - 11:50pm\",\n          monday: \"11:00am - 11:50pm\",\n          wednesday: \"11:00am - 11:50pm\"\n        }\n      },\n      LEC_004: {\n        instructor: \"Mouna Ayari Ben Hadj Kacem\",\n        location: \"1310 Sterling Hall\",\n        subsections: {},\n        time: {\n          friday: \"2:25pm - 3:15pm\",\n          monday: \"2:25pm - 3:15pm\",\n          wednesday: \"2:25pm - 3:15pm\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    subject: \"Computer Science\"\n  },\n  nbt: {\n    credits: 5,\n    description: \"Introduction to differential and integral calculus and plane analytic geometry;

Students are required to design and implement using high quality professional code, a medium sized program, that demonstrates knowledge and use of latest language features, tools, and conventions. Additional topics introduced will include as needed for projects: inheritance and polymorphism; anonymous inner classes, lambda functions, performance analysis to discover and optimize critical code blocks. Students learn about industry standards for code development. Students will design and implement a medium size project with a more advanced user-interface design, such as a web or mobile application with a GUI and event- driven implementation; use of version-control software.\",\n                keywords: [\n                    \"computer\",\n                    \"science\",\n                    \"programming\",\n                    \"java\"\n                ],\n                    name: \"Programming 3\",\n                        number: \"COMP SCI 400\",\n                            requisites: [\n                                [\n                                    \"glv\"\n                                ]\n                            ],\n                                sections: {\n            LEC_001: {\n                instructor: \"Gary Dahl\",\n                    location: \"AB20 Weeks Hall for Geological Sciences\",\n                        subsections: { },\n                time: {\n                    thursday: \"2:30pm -
